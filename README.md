### **_Description_**

#### This is a browser game written in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Users move a basic bird through a shifting maze of obstacles. The bird is constantly decrementing down the Y axis. The user increments its positionon the Y axis byclicking a button. If the user allows the bird to touch an obstacle or the bottom of the playing area, they lose. There is no end of the game. Users earn points based on how long they play before losing.
